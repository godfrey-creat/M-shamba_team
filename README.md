FarmEye: Intelligent Farm Monitoring and Disease Detection System 

##H2
Welcome to FarmEye â€“ an intelligent, easy-to-use farm monitoring system that helps farmers grow more with less stress. This project uses IoT, AI, and simple-to-use dashboards to solve real problems farmers face every day.

#H1
What is FarmEye?

##H2
FarmEye is an intelligent monitoring system for farms. It helps to:
###H3
Detect crop type
Predict disease type
Detect irrigation issues

##H2
All this information is collected in the field using sensors, and you can see it all on your phone or computer at once. 

#H1
Why It Matters
##H2
In most of the globe, especially rural areas, farmers still rely on walking rounds to monitor their crops. That is time and cost-intensive, and at times problems are identified too late. FarmEye helps do away with that by giving real-time reports and guidance so farmers can act promptly.

This program also contributes significantly to global major goals such as:

###H3
Zero Hunger

Responsible Production

Climate Action

Innovation in Agriculture

#H1
Who It's For
##H2
FarmEye is for anyone who grows food:

###H3
Small farmers with 1-10 acres

Large farms that need to keep an eye on big areas

Cooperatives who help many farmers at once

##H2
No matter the size, FarmEye helps farmers use less water, fewer chemicals, and make better decisions.

#H1
How It Works
##H2
FarmEye integrates a few essential tools:

###H3
Field Sensors that monitor conditions 24/7

AI Tools that identify crop health, pests, and more

Aerial Photos that indicate farm-wide problems

Easy-to-use Dashboard, even on a phone

Everything is saved in the cloud for safe storage and easy access later.
