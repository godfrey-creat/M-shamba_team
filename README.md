FarmEye: Intelligent Farm Monitoring and Disease Detection System 

Welcome to FarmEye â€“ an intelligent, easy-to-use farm monitoring system that helps farmers grow more with less stress. This project uses IoT, AI, and simple-to-use dashboards to solve real problems farmers face every day.

What is FarmEye?
FarmEye is an intelligent monitoring system for farms. It helps monitor such as:

Detect crop type

Humidity and sunlight levels

Crop health and pests

Irrigation issues

All this information is collected in the field using sensors, and you can see it all on your phone or computer at once. 

Why It Matters
In most of the globe, especially rural areas, farmers still rely on walking rounds to monitor their crops. That is time and cost-intensive, and at times problems are identified too late. FarmEye helps do away with that by giving real-time reports and guidance so farmers can act promptly.

This program also contributes significantly to global major goals such as:

Zero Hunger

Responsible Production

Climate Action

Innovation in Agriculture

Who It's For
FarmEye is for anyone who grows food:

Small farmers with 1-10 acres

Large farms that need to keep an eye on big areas

Cooperatives who help many farmers at once

No matter the size, FarmEye helps farmers use less water, fewer chemicals, and make better decisions.

How It Works
FarmEye integrates a few essential tools:

Field Sensors that monitor conditions 24/7

AI Tools that identify crop health, pests, and more

Aerial Photos that indicate farm-wide problems

Easy-to-use Dashboard, even on a phone

Everything is saved in the cloud for safe storage and easy access later.

Tech Stack
IoT Sensors (custom-built, weather-proof)

Cloud Database (for safe storage of data)

AI Models (for disease and crop detection)

Mobile & Web Dashboard (for real-time monitoring)
